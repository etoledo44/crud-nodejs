# API Crud

Hi! This is my project using JavaScript and **node.js** :green_heart: for the back-end application. So to this application I build an API with its concepts and methods.


## Language
As I mentioned I used JavaScript in my crud. Also the new features of EcmaScript 6 (ES6).

## Frameworks
- Express
	> Express has a great importance in whole project because this framework manage the server, routes and json response too.
- Sequelize, Sequelize CLI and mysql2
	>  These frameworks manage whole structure of database, models, migrations and seeds. And I use that concepts.
	**Commands I used:**
	>>`yarn sequelize init` command to init a sequelize structure.
	`yarn sequelize model:generate --name Exemple --attributes firstName:string,lastName:string,email:string` command to generate a model table.
	`yarn sequelize db:migrate` command to create a table in your database.
	`yarn sequelize seed:generate --name demo-user` command to generate your first seed to your model(demo-YOURMODELNAME).
	`yarn sequelize db:seed:all` command to seeding your table.
	
## Tools
- INSOMNIA
    > Finally the best program to test your API requests and responses.
	   
## Run project  
 - To run this project you must have to install **node.js** ;
 - Must have a package manager like **npm** or [**yarn**]([https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)) (I recommend yarn :smile: );
	 > After you download the project you have to execute this command on your terminal: `yarn install` - this command will download the dependencies that I use.
	 - Run `yarn start` to init the application.
- Enjoy the application.
